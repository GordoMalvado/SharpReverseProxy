SharpReverseProxy
=================

Powerful Reverse Proxy written as OWIN Middleware. Perfect for asp.net, web.api, microservices, etc.

Looking for a way to build an API Gateway based on rules, I found the [Asp.Net Proxy repository](https://github.com/aspnet/Proxy).

The problem is that it proxies all request and I would like to have granular control of the proxy rules. So I created SharpReverseProxy :)
